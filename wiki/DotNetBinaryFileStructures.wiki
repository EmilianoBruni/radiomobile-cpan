#summary Analize the structure inside .net Radio Mobile file

= Introduction =

This document analizes the structure of the configuration file .net saved by Radio Mobile software.

The .net is a binary file. Its macro structure has build by these blocks

  * [#Header Header] informatio
  * [#Units Units] information list
  * [#Systems Systems] information list
  * [#UnitsNetsRole UnitsNetsRole] with Units `<->` Nets association and the role of every unit in every net
  * [#UnitsSystem UnitsSystem] with system of every unit in every net
  * [#Nets Nets] information list
  * [#Cov Cov] with coverage settings
  * [#MapFilePath MapFilePath] with the path to .map file
  * [#Pictures Pictures] list path to load
  * [#UnitsHeight UnitsHeight] setting height of every unit in every net
  * [#UnitIcon UnitIcon] with the icon of every unit
  * [#SystemCableLoss SystemCableLoss] with additional cable loss for every system
  * [#StyleNetworksProperties StyleNetworksProperties] with style networks properties window settings
  * [#NetUnknown1 NetUnknown1], a (currently) unknown network property
  * [#SystemAntenna SystemAntenna], the antenna setting for every system
  * [#UnitsAzimutDirection UnitsAzimutDirection], the azimut or unit direction of antenna in every unit in every net
  * [#UnitUnknown1 UnitUnknown1], a (currently) unknown unit property
  * [#UnitsElevation UnitsElevation], the elevation angle of antenna in every unit in every net
  * [#VersionNumberAgain VersionNumberAgain] with the version number (again)
  * [#TwoByteZeros TwoByteZeros], a (currently unknown) two bytes zerofilled
  * [#LandHeight LandHeight] with path to landheight file 


=Header=

The file begins with a 10 byte structure with header and general information.

=Units=

Following there are "UNITS COUNT" elements which describe every unit of the simulation.

Every unit is a structure 44 bytes long with these property
